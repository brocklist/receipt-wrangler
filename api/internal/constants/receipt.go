// CUSTOM_FIELD_ASSOCIATIONS loads a receipt's custom field values together with
// the definition (and options) each value is read against.
//
// The definition is NOT optional. models.CustomFieldValue.CustomField is a
// non-pointer struct with no omitempty, so loading the values alone still
// serializes a zero-valued definition — including "type":"" — and the mobile
// client's generated CustomFieldType is a closed enum with no empty member.
// A value it cannot deserialize is swallowed by the one_of AnyOfSerializer,
// which would collapse every receipt row in the app rather than error. See
// mobile/CLAUDE.md -> "Serialization contract".
