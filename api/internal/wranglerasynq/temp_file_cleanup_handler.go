// The temp/ sweeper reclaims files the ingest pipelines leave behind, without
// ever deleting one that something can still act on.
//
// It replaces a cleanup that was exactly inverted: it released a file once every
// referencing task was Completed OR Archived, and Archived is precisely the state
// that makes an activity rerunnable. Worse, no queue set asynq.Retention at the
// time, so a successfully-processed task was dropped from Redis immediately and
// never entered the completed set — meaning the old Completed branch could never
// fire and the only files it ever deleted were the ones it had to keep.
//
// Rule 3 is live now, but on the email queue alone: enqueueOptions attaches
// asynq.Retention there so a succeeded task survives long enough for this sweep to
// see it. Quick scan is excluded because it deletes its own file on success and is
// 1:1 task-to-file, so its completed tasks would name a path that no longer exists.
//
// Two invariants keep the orphan branch safe, because the failure mode inverted
// with it. Previously a task the scan missed meant "we fail to delete" (harmless);
// now it means the file looks unreferenced and is deleted once aged. So:
//
//  1. every inspector list call pages (asynq defaults to 30 per page), and
//  2. any gap in the scan stands the orphan branch down for that run — a listing
//     error, an unreadable payload, or a listing that ran past the page cap.
//
// Rules 1-3 below rest on positive evidence — a state we actually observed — so
// they stay live even when the reference map is known-incomplete.
