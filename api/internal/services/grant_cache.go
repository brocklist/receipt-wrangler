// for O(1) membership tests. An EMPTY set means that resource is unrestricted
// (the role grants every category/tag) — so categories and tags are independent:
// a role may restrict categories while leaving tags unrestricted, or vice versa.
// Callers must treat the maps as read-only (they are shared cache state).
//
// paidByUserIds / includeOwnPaidReceipts carry the row-level "paid by" visibility
// filter. paidByUserIds holds ONLY the absolute granted user ids — the relative
// "their own receipts" token (includeOwnPaidReceipts) is unioned with the
// requesting user's id at resolution time, never stored here, because this cache
// is keyed by role id and shared across every member holding that role.

// resolved fresh on every check, so re-assigning a user takes effect
// immediately. Invalidated whenever a group role is updated or deleted.
