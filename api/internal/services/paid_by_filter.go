// This file holds the row-level "paid by" visibility enforcement: which receipts
// a group role lets its members see, keyed on the receipt's paid_by_user_id.
// Unlike the category/tag grants (which strip fields off a still-visible receipt
// in grant_filter.go), paid-by hides the WHOLE receipt — so enforcement adds a
// WHERE to the paged query (PaidByListResolver), denies single-receipt access
// (ReceiptPaidByVisible), and post-filters the unpaginated read surfaces
// (FilterReceiptsByPaidBy). No request-filter intersection is needed: because the
// paged query already row-filters on the allowed set, a caller filtering by a
// payer they cannot see is neutralized by that AND (a hidden id intersects to
// nothing), so it cannot probe receipt existence.
//
// Member isolation is folded in at the single shared resolution point
// (paidByAllowedForGroup) so all three consumers below inherit it: an isolated
// member must not see a receipt paid by a user outside their member-visible set for
// that group, even in a group whose role applies no paid-by restriction of its own.
// The member-visible set is resolved PER GROUP (GetVisibleUserIdsForUserInGroup) and
// intersected into that group's paid-by allowed set, so an isolated group hides its
// non-visible payers regardless of any open group the viewer also shares. It is a
// no-op for unrestricted viewers (admins, supervisors, and non-isolated members), so
// non-isolated installs behave exactly as before.

// PaidByListResolver adapts paidByAllowedForGroup to the per-group resolver the
// receipt repository uses to build its paged WHERE clause. The returned closure
// reports the allowed paid_by_user_id values for userId in a group, or
// unrestricted == true (see every payer). Both the paid-by grants and the member-visible
// set are resolved per group inside paidByAllowedForGroup. Pass the result to
// GetPagedReceiptsByGroupId; pass nil there to skip paid-by filtering.
