// The scan slot has to keep working after its menu closes.
//
// Regression: the long-press action used to run on `onLongPress`, which fires at
// the 500ms mark with the finger still down. Opening the menu route there left
// the gesture recognizer holding a pointer it never saw released, and that slice
// then ignored every later tap and hold — a slot that worked exactly once per
// app launch. Running on `onLongPressUp` instead lets the gesture finish first.
//
// This lives in the e2e suite on purpose: a minimal widget harness delivers the
// pointer-up cleanly enough that the recognizer recovers, so the equivalent
// widget test passes even with the bug present. Only the real app reproduces it.
