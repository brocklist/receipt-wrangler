/// Keeps a pinned bottom bar clear of the software keyboard.
///
/// `Scaffold` lifts its `bottomSheet` slot for free -- that one lands at
/// `contentBottom`, which already subtracts `viewInsets.bottom` -- but it pins
/// `bottomNavigationBar` to the physical bottom of the scaffold
/// (`max(0, height - bottomWidgetsHeight)`, with no inset term). So the slot
/// chosen precisely *because* it reserves its space is the one an open keyboard
/// buries, which is how the Quick Scan submit button ended up under it.
///
/// The value is not computed or guessed: `viewInsets.bottom` *is* the top of the
/// keyboard, reported by the platform and updated every frame while it slides,
/// so the bar follows it exactly -- including split, floating and hardware
/// keyboards.
///
/// The [Builder] is load-bearing. Widgets are inflated where they are mounted,
/// not where they are constructed, so its context lands inside the bar slot --
/// which is the only place the value survives. `Scaffold` strips the bottom
/// inset from the **body** slot's `MediaQuery` (`removeBottomInset`) but not
/// from this one, so reading it any higher, or from inside the body, yields 0
/// and this silently does nothing. It also scopes the rebuild to the bar.
///
/// Nothing double-counts against the [SafeArea] below: that consumes
/// `padding.bottom`, which is `viewPadding - viewInsets` floored at 0 and so is
/// reported as 0 for exactly as long as the keyboard is up. The two are
/// complementary, never additive.
///
/// Plain [Padding], deliberately not `AnimatedPadding`: the scaffold body
/// resizes un-animated off the same value, so animating here would put the bar
/// out of step with the body it has to sit against.
